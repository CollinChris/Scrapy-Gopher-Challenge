This is a scraping challenge to scrape the site https://gopher1.extrkt.com/ , the spider goes through each product page and scrapes price, description, name, colours, sizes etc.
Currently this iteration of code is yielding about 60 extra results so I am trying to fix that, but other wise it is scraping correctly
